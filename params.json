We introduce artificial point mutations on the NGS reads at the nucleotide level to define a test statistic for each genome in bacterial reference database; we also use a variant of the Westfall-Young procedure to correct for multiple comparisons.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain a copy of the source code by:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_computer/your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/camilo-v/Metagenomics.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nThe software was developed on OS X (10.9) and covers four (4) programming languages:\r\n\r\n- Python (2.7 variant)\r\n- Perl (perl 5, v.16 or above)\r\n- R (3.1 or above)\r\n- Bash Shell\r\n\r\nYou will need a reasonably modern computer and operating system that can support all four.\r\n\r\n#### Bowtie2\r\n\r\n[Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) is required for the alignment step.  See the Bowtie2 [Getting Started](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#getting-started-with-bowtie-2-lambda-phage-example) guide for instructions on installing and running Bowtie2.\r\n\r\n#### Samtools\r\n\r\n[Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) is required for parsing the alignments and generating miscellaneous alignment statistics.  See the [Samtools Documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/) for instructions on installing and running Samtools.\r\n\r\n### Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [Camilo Valdes](mailto:cvaldes3@miami.edu)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Collaborators\r\n\r\n- [Jennifer Clarke](mailto:jclarke3@unl.edu)\r\n- [Bertrand Clarke](mailto:bclarke3@unl.edu)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nContact [Camilo Valdes](mailto:cvaldes3@miami.edu) for pull requests, and/or bug reports.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

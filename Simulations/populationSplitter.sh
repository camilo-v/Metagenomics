#
#   OBJECTIVE:
#	The purpose of this script is to split a conditional population file into sub-files that contains a
#	maximum of 50 entries each.  This constraint is due to MetaSim - it cannot load a large database all
#	at once.  A starting conditional population of 600 generates a file of about 2GB, and MetaSim is just
#	incapable of loading it.  So we have to split the large file into files that it can handle -- 50 has
#	been the magic number so far.
#
#
#   NOTES:
#   Please see the dependencies section below for the required libraries (if any).
#
#   DEPENDENCIES:
#
#       â€¢ None. Uses standard python foundation classes.
#
#   The above libraries & modules are required. You can check the modules currently installed in your
#   system by running: python -c "help('modules')"
#
#   USAGE:
#   Run the program with the "--help" flag to see usage instructions.
